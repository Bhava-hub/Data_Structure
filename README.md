Data Structures and Algorithms Lab Exercises

This repository contains all the implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms exercises completed during my lab sessions. It includes solutions for various problems covering fundamental to advanced concepts such as binary trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching techniques, and dynamic programming. Each section is organized by topic, with clear and commented code to demonstrate my understanding and application of these concepts.

The repository is structured to make it easy to navigate through different topics, with separate directories for binary trees (including traversals, BST), graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, and shortest-path algorithms), sorting techniques, and searching methods. Additionally, there are implementations of dynamic programming problems, and other essential DSA topics.

All code is written in [Programming Language:C++], with an emphasis on clarity, efficiency, and correctness. This repository serves as a reference for my learning journey in DSA and a resource for others looking for well-documented solutions to common problems. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!
